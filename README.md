# Project Summary

This repository aims to compare the performances of multiple machine learning (ML) algorisms when the data distribution is highly imbalanced with one overwhelming response category. The dataset was randomly divided into two parts: training and test sets. Then, I will develop a statistical model out of the training set and apply it to the test set, recording down the misclassification errors. Furthermore, I will use ROC and AUC to compare the performances and conclude KNN, as a non-parametrical method, outperforms the others when the distribution is highly imbalanced. 

Installing

This project is conducted in the R environment, and you have to pre-install the following libraries: readr, knitr, dplyr, plyr, class, reshape2, tree, randomForest, car, and e1071.

What is the data?

This dataset is collected by a Portuguese banking institution to assess the effect of direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) in predicting if the client will subscribe a term deposit. The data source can be accessed here at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing.
